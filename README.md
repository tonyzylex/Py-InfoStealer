------------------------------------
once the script has been ran, .exe or vs code date and time username, device name, priv ip, pub ip, os version/name, cpu archi, mac address, takes pictures using camera, and keystrokes [press esc to end, keylogger only]. it will save it on a local text file (meow_meow_hacklog but u can change this if u want to lowk)
------------------------------------


please dont run this if you do not own the machine or you do not have permission from the owner. this is to test my capabilities in cybersec (which as you can tell sucks at the moment). i will be running this only on my own pc. DO NOT USE THIS FOR ILLEGAL PURPOSES! :))))

to turn into an executable file:
go to the directory where the file is saved
open terminal
type " pyinstaller --onefile [name of file] --hidden-import [name of file] --noconsole
