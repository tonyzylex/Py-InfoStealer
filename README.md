# python-infostealer-own-pc-only
grabs timestamp if the script has been ran, username, device name, priv ip, pub ip, os version/name, cpu archi, mac address. puts it all into one text file

please dont run this if you do not own the machine or you dont have permission from the owner. this is to test my capabilities in cybersec (which as you can tell sucks at the moment). i will be running this only on my own pc. DO NOT USE THIS FOR ILLEGAL PURPOSES! :))))

to turn into an executable file:
go to the directory where the file is saved
open terminal
type " pyinstaller --onefile [name of file] --hidden-import [name of file] --noconsole
